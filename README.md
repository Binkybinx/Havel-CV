# Hazel-CV

The Hazel CV Project helped me undertand the following:

- Differentiate between various CSS units such as px, rem, %, vh, vw
- Utilize the float property to create a multi-column layout.
- Target specific selectors such as element, class, ID and use combinators such as descendant, and child combinators.
